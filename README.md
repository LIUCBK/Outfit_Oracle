Hi everyone! My name is Jocelyn and I'm a senior at BC studying Education and Computer Science! 
My App is called Outfit Oracle, which can offer smart clothes recommendations based on today's date and weather. 
I personally love matching different kinds of clothes, but I often don't remember what I have in my closet especially as I buy more and more...
This app allows you to upload pictures of your clothes and gives you a combinatin of jacket, top and bottome tailors to today's weather! 
If, by any chance, you're not satisfied with the combination, you can always hit Refresh button below to let it generate a new set for you! 
Additionally, if today is a special day, like it is Patrick's day, it will also remind you ðŸŒ±Remember to wear Green for today!
If you navigate to the Closet tab, you will see all the clothes that you previsouly uploaded before with all the information about that particular clothes. 
You can always hit the button on the top right corner to add a piece of clothes and manually fill in the type of the clothes, thickness, color and texture. 
And after you click on save, your new clothes will be automatically save to your online closet!
Besides, we have a profile page for you to enter your user name and you'll see all your history outfit with your personaly ratings!

Welcome to Outfit Oracle and hope you can wear something makes you happy everyday :)
